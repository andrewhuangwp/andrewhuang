                <p>
                    I have played tennis for over 10 years now and love to play it in my free time. I used to compete in junior tennis tournaments and still compete 
                    now through the Northeastern Club Tennis Team.

                <h6>Hackathons</h6>
                <p>
                    I recently found out about Hackathons and participated in my first in December 2019 at the 2019 MIT Hacking Arts. Although it was mentally and physically fatiguing,
                    I had a lot of fun meeting new people and working with Virtual Reality. Plus my team was able to win the Hackers' Choice Award! 
                    I am currently registered for HackBeanpot 2020 and look forward to participating in more Hackathons in the future.

                <h6>Music</h6>
                <p>
                    Music has always been a part of my life: I started playing the piano since I was 6, the cello since I was 8, and I'm currently learning the guitar. I'm always constantly
                    listening to music wherever I am and love to listen to all sorts of music.
